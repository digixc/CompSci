## Year 9 Computer Science Unit: Game Development 

| Objective:

+ Develop understanding of components of game development using programming language
+ Develop programming skills to implement working solutions/games
+ Develop problem solving skills in the context and process of game making

| Learning outcomes:

+ Be able to draw at least 4 different shapes with various sizes, colours, line thickness, filled or not filled and at any given locations
+ Be able to animate shapes and detect boundaries of a game screen using variables, loops and if statements
+ Be able to use images (load, scale) as sprites or backgrounds
+ Be able to use events, mouse clicking and key pressing to control a game
+ be able to apply collision detection in game and use if statements to decide what happens when collision detected

| Learning pathway:

In this unit, you will build your coding experience as you create programmatic images, animations, and interactive games.  
Starting off with simple, primitive shapes and colours, and building up to more sophisticated sprite-based games using shapes and images, you will become familiar with the programming concepts and the design process computer scientists use daily.  
You will then learn how these simpler constructs can be combined to create more complex programs. 
In the final project, you will develop a personalized, interactive game. 
Along the way, you will practice design, testing, and iteration, as you come to see that failure and debugging are an expected and valuable part of the programming process.

### Lesson 1: Colours and Shapes
#### Objectives: 
+ Understand how computers represent colours using RGB colour components 
+ Understand how computers draw shapes using different properties given such as coordinates, colours and other parameters 
+ Understand how humans communicate to a computer what colours to display for text and shapes and how to draw shapes

#### Outcomes: 
+ Students will be able to use RGB colour values to create different colours and assign them to variables to be used in their game program
+ Students will be able to understand and plot shapes for given locations, dimensions and other properties such as colour, fill etc
+ Students will be able to produce a complex background image by combining learnt skills to be used for their game

### Lesson 2: FPS, Images and Events
#### Objectives: 
+ Understand how animation works in programming a game 
+ Understand how computers control the speed of screen refresh rate (Frame Per Second)
+ Understand what computer events are and how events are detected and used in game making

#### Outcomes: 
+ Students will be able to adjust FPS to tailor their animation in their game program
+ Students will be able to load images from files and scale them to appropriate sizes for their games
+ Students will be able to use key board events to control their sprite and close their game smoothly
