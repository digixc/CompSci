## <a id="microbit">Year 9 Computer Science Unit: Physical Computing with Micro:bit </a>

| Objectives:

+ Develop understanding of the basic hardware components of a modern computer
+ Develop understanding that computers, big or small, need precise instructions from people to work
+ Develop programming skills by implementing solutions to practical problems
+ Develop problem solving skills 

| Learning outcomes:

+ Be able to name hardware components of a basic computer and describe their purposes
+ Be able to understand basic operations of a computer - input, process and output
+ Be able to create precise instructions using programming language 
+ Be able to use programming language constructs logically when solving problems 


| Learning pathway:

In this unit, you will develop your understanding that computers can be in many forms and that all computers work by processing some inputs and produce outputs. You will be able to identify basic components of a computer and describe their functions in a computer system.  
Starting off with simple programming tasks of controling the outputs of the Microbits to produce text and images.  Then you will use some inputs like buttons to control the outputs using conditional statements of Python.  
You will then learn how to use the built-in accelerometer to detect motions and gestures and program solutions that are motion or gesture controlled.  With some basic understanding how radio waves transmit data, you will program a radio messaging application to send messages to your classmates.
