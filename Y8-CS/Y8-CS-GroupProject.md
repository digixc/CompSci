## Year 8 Computer Science Unit: Group Project 

| Objectives:

+ To develop research and information synthesising skill 
+ To develop time and task management skill 
+ To develop and enforcing problem solving and practical programming skill 
+ To develop presentation and communication skill 

| Learning outcomes:

+ Be able to draw at least 4 different shapes with various sizes, colours, line thickness, filled or not filled and at any given locations
+ Be able to animate shapes and detect boundaries of a game screen using variables, loops and if statements
+ Be able to use images (load, scale) as sprites or backgrounds
+ Be able to use events, mouse clicking and key pressing to control a game
+ be able to apply collision detection in game and use if statements to decide what happens when collision detected

| Learning pathway:

In this unit, students are expected to work in a group of two.  They will use nine lessons to complete a task of of their choice from a given list of topics. 
For their chosen topic, you are expected to: 
+ conduct some in-depth research on the topic 
+ divide the topic into broad aspects/categories 
+ come up with a list of quiz like questions for each aspect/category 
+ program a quiz using a programming language of your choice, such as Scratch, or Python using the quiz questions from bulletin point 2 
+ present your research work using PowerPoint, Publisher, Canva or webpages to the class

### Lesson 1: Planning

#### Objectives: 
+ Understand the scope of their project
+ Understand how to divide the project into sub tasks 
+ Understand how to develop quiz questions that can be programmed for assessment

#### Outcomes: 
+ Students will have chosen a topic
+ Students will be able to put the topic into sub categories to narrow down their research scopes
+ Students will have a team plan with divided responsibilities for their chosen project

---
### Lesson 2: Research
#### Objectives: 
+ Understand how animation works in programming a game 
+ Understand how computers control the speed of screen refresh rate (Frame Per Second)
+ Understand what computer events are and how events are detected and used in game making

#### Outcomes: 
+ Students will be able to adjust FPS to tailor their animation in their game program
+ Students will be able to load images from files and scale them to appropriate sizes for their games
+ Students will be able to use key board events to control their sprite and close their game smoothly
