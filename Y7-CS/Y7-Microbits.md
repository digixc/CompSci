## Year 7 Computer Science Unit: Computing Fundamentals with MicroBits 

| Objectives:
+ understand and apply the fundamental principles & concepts of computer science.
+ gain practical experience of writing computer programs to solve problems.
+ evaluate and apply information technology, including new or unfamiliar technologies analytically to solve problems
+ be responsible, competent, confident and creative users of information and communication technology.

| Learning outcomes:
+ create a real life algorithm to design a paper aeroplane
+ design a prototype of a computerized paper aeroplane
+ understand how algorithms are formed using flowcharts and pseudocode
+ experiment with iteration and selection
+ understand computer systems and create programs for the BBC micro:bit 
+ create a presentation explaining their learning about computer systems and programming concepts 

| Learning pathway:

<p>Student's begin the academic year off by learning fundamental computing concepts that are intrinsic in computer Science. These concepts underpin this subject not just within school, but also the workplace. The students will develop algorithmic thinking through unplugged activities such as designing pseudocode for a paper aeroplane, before they experiment with coding the BBC Micro: Bit. They will use this knowledge to develop programs that can be implemented on the external microbit device.</p>
